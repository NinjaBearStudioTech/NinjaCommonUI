# Ninja CommonUI
Base classes and utilities for an User Interface based on Common UI.

The Ninja CommonUI plugin offers a base set of widgets, HUD and common operations that will establish a general
architecture for a CommonUI-based interface.

This is just an internal library, not aiming for the Marketplace, so there's no official documentation or support
for this at this moment. In the Future, once this framework matures a bit further, a documentation will be added.
